low Speed (cycle 20): 
   num transitions = 50
   num rotations = 50transitions/4  = 12.5 rotations 
   rps = 12.5 rotations/4 sec = 3.124 rotations per second
   rpm = 3.124 rps*60 sec = 187.5 rotations per min
   calc_rpm calculated the speed to be 192 rpm
 
 medium speed (cycle 50):
   num transitions = 96 
   num rotations = 96 transitions /4 = 24 rotations
   rps = 24 rotations / 4 sec = 6 rotations per second
   rpm = 6 rps *60 secc = 360 rotations per min
   calc_rpm calculated the speed to be 361 rpm
    
high speed (cycle 90):
   num transitions = 117
   num rotations = 117 transitions/4 = 29.25 rotations
   rps = 29.25 rotations / 4 sec = 7.3125 rotations per second
   rpm = 7.3125 rps * 60 sec = 438.75 rotations per min
   calc_rpm calculated the speed to be 455 rpm

There are some difference between our manually calculated speed and the program speed because we are estimating the time and there may be some error with counting the number of transitions
 
Using fft to determine speed
low speed (cycle 20):
   first spike at about 6 hz
   6hz/2 cycles = 3 rps
   3 rps * 60 sec = 180 rpm

medium speed (cycle 50):
   first spike at about 12 hz
   12 hz/2 cycles = 6 rps
   6 rps * 60 sec = 360 rpm

high speed (cycle 90):
   first spike at about 14 hz
   14hz / 2 cycles = 7 rps
   7 rps * 60 sec = 420 rpm
   
Getting the speed from the fft graph is an approximation because we are estimating where the first spike is 

Note: We sampled at 100hz when collecting our data
